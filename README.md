How To Use

1.Install your favourite code editor.

2.Make sure HTML,CSS,JavaScript is supported on it.

3.Install Live Server Extension on it.

4.Open the index.html file and then open it with live server.

5.BOOM..You can check your Date and Time.

Disclamer...

Opening the index.html file directly without using any code editor/live server may not work as the time needs to be updated every second.

ENJOY....
